        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>StrathCart is a student-focused online grocery platform developed by and for the students of Strathmore University, offering a 
            seamless, affordable, and reliable solution to everyday grocery shopping. We understand the challenges students face—tight schedules, 
            limited budgets, long queues at local stores, and the hassle of last-minute shopping. StrathCart eliminates these stressors by delivering a 
            wide range of fresh fruits, vegetables, and essentials directly to hostels or pickup points on campus. 
            With features like MPESA payments, delivery scheduling, dietary preferences, and smart bundles, we make grocery shopping faster, 
            easier, and tailored to student needs.</p>

        <h4>Our Vision</h4>
        <p>At StrathCart, our vision is to become the leading campus-based grocery solution in Kenya—starting with Strathmore and expanding across other institutions. 
            We aim to empower students with convenient access to healthy food, promote mindful eating habits, and leverage technology to simplify student life. Beyond convenience, 
            we envision a platform that supports local farmers, reduces food waste through smart inventory systems, and builds a community of informed, 
            health-conscious students. StrathCart isn’t just about groceries—it’s about rethinking how students shop, eat, and live, one campus at a time.</p>
